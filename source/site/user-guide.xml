    <title>Introduction</title>

    <para>Amigaguide is a file format and application for AmigaOS<footnote>
        <para>The original Amigaguide is still available from any Aminet
        mirror, for example <ulink
        url="http://aminet.net/text/hyper/aguide34.lha"></ulink>.</para>
      </footnote>. It enables to author and view hypertext documentation to
    some extend comparable to HTML or WinHelp. Most of the online
    documentation written for Amiga applications or about developing Amiga
    applications uses Amigaguide. Outside of AmigaOS however Amigaguide is
    unused and consequently hardly any viewers exist.</para>

    <para>Altough most Amigaguide documents are not particular useful without
    access to an Amiga (real or emulated), occasionally a need arises to read
    such documentation on other platforms. Grotag is designed to address this
    need. It allows to convert Amigaguide documents to the platform
    independent HTML format, for which viewers exist on any reasonably modern
    system. Furthermore you can convert to DocBook, a format popular for
    technical documentations, allowing to bring along existing manuals into
    the 21st century for further editing.</para>

    <para>Grotag is written in Java (version 1.5 or later), which is supported
    by many current platforms such as Mac OS X (version 10.5 or later),
    Windows and Linux to name just a few.</para>

    <para>To find out what is new in this version, see the <link
    linkend="changes">revision history</link>. For updates and support, visit
    the Grotag homepage at <ulink
    url="http://grotag.sourceforge.net/">http://grotag.sourceforge.net</ulink>.</para>

  <chapter id="installation">
    <title>Installation</title>

    <section id="download">
      <title>Mac OS X</title>

      <para>For Mac OS X, visit <ulink
      url="http://grotag.sourceforge.net/">http://grotag.sourceforge.net</ulink>
      and download <filename>Grotag-x.y-z.dmg</filename>, where
      <filename>x.y.z</filename> refers to the current version number. Double
      click the disk archive to mount its contents as new device and open it
      in the Finder. It contains an application named Grotag resp. Grotag.app.
      Simply drag and drop this application in any folder you like to launch
      it from, for example <filename>/Applications</filename> or
      <filename>~/Applications</filename>.</para>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Other platforms</title>

      <para>For other platforms, visit <ulink
      url="http://grotag.sourceforge.net/">http://grotag.sourceforge.net</ulink>
      and download <filename>Grotag-x.y.zip</filename>, where
      <filename>x.y.z</filename> refers to the current version number. After
      extracting the archive, you should see at least the following
      files:</para>

      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>Grotag.jar - The application Java archive.</para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>

      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>license.txt - A text file describing your rights related to
          Grotag. In short: It is an Open Source application and you do not
          have to pay money for it.</para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>

      <para>Now simply move Grotag.jar to a folder from where you want to
      start it. Under Windows, this could be in <filename>C:\Programe
      Files</filename>, under Unix it might be
      <filename>/usr/local/bin</filename> or
      <filename>~/bin</filename>.</para>

      <para>To launch Grotag from most Desktop environtments, simply double
      click <filename>Grotag.jar</filename>. In case this does not work you
      have to use the command line as described in <xref
      linkend="command-line-usage" />.</para>
    </section>
  </chapter>

  <chapter>
    <title>The user interface</title>

    <para>This chapter describes how to perform common tasks with Grotag using
    the graphical user interface. This provides a comfortable way to access
    most functions using the mouse and keyboard. For repetetive tasks and
    automatization a probaly better choice is described in <xref
    linkend="command-line-usage" />.</para>

    <section>
      <title>Launch Grotag</title>

      <para>To launch Grotag under Mac OS X, simply double click the
      application icon or drop a <filename>*.guide</filename> file on
      it.</para>

      <para>To launch Grotag on most other platforms, simply double click
      <filename>Grotag.jar</filename> on the desktop.</para>

      <para>In case this does not work, open a terminal window (console) and
      enter:</para>

      <para><userinput>java -jar .../path/to/Grotag.jar</userinput></para>

      <para>Soon after that Grotag should present you an empty window.</para>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Open an Amigaguide document</title>

      <para>In order to read an Amigaguide document, you have to open one
      using the menu entry <menuchoice>
          <guimenu>File</guimenu>

          <guimenuitem>Open</guimenuitem>
        </menuchoice>. In the resulting dialog select the file and click the
      <guibutton>Open</guibutton> button. Grotag loads the document, including
      all linked documents. For complex guides (such as the Amiga ROM Kernel
      Reference Manuals) this may take a while. Watch the progress bar in the
      lower right corner of the window to estimate how long it still going to
      take.</para>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Browse a document</title>

      <para>Once the document has been loaded, you can browse it. As
      Amigaguide is a hyper text format just like HTML, viewers for it are
      fairly similar similar to web browsers.</para>
    </section>
  </chapter>

  <chapter id="command-line-usage">
    <title>Command line usage</title>

    <section id="command-line-launch">
      <title>Launch Grotag</title>

      <para>To launch Grotag from the command line, open a terminal window
      (console) and enter:</para>

      <para><userinput>java -jar .../path/to/Grotag.jar
      --help</userinput></para>

      <para>Replace "<filename>.../path/to/</filename>" by the location of the
      folder you extracted <filename>Grotag.zip</filename> to and where
      <filename>Grotag.jar</filename> is located.</para>

      <para>As a result, you should see a short decription of the options you
      can pass to Grotag. Don't worry about them now, all of them will be
      explained later in this chapter.</para>

      <para>Because it is somewhat boring to type that much each time you want
      to launch Grotag, it is recommended to define a console alias. In bash,
      simply enter:</para>

      <para><userinput>alias grotag="java -jar
      .../path/to/Grotag.jar"</userinput></para>

      <para>After that, you can simply run</para>

      <para><userinput>grotag --help</userinput></para>

      <para>to get same result as before. To avoid having to retype the alias
      each time you open a new terminal, add it to the shell startup file (for
      example <filename>~/.bashrc</filename> or
      <filename>~/.profile</filename> depending on your platform.)</para>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Show help and other information</title>

      <para>To read a short description of all options available for Grotag,
      run:</para>

      <para><userinput>grotag --help</userinput></para>

      <para>To learn which version of Grotag you are using, run:</para>

      <para><userinput>grotag --version</userinput></para>

      <para>To obtain information about Grotag's license, run:</para>

      <para><userinput>grotag --license</userinput></para>
    </section>

    <section id="command-line-validate">
      <title>Validate Amigaguide documents</title>

      <para>To validate an Amigaguide document named
      <filename>some.guide</filename>, run:</para>

      <para><userinput>grotag --validate some.guide</userinput></para>

      <para>In case Grotag detects any inconsistencies, it will report what it
      would have done in order to fix them. This isn't necessarily what you
      would have done to fix them, but still shows exactly where something is
      wrong.</para>

      <para>If you trust Grotag to do the right thing, you can let it fix the
      reported issues by using the command line option
      <userinput>--pretty</userinput>.</para>
    </section>

    <section id="command-line-pretty">
      <title>Pretty print and fix Amigaguide documents</title>

      <para>Amigaguide never came with an authoring tool or a formal
      specification of the format. Consequently many existing Amigaguide
      documents contain little inconsistencies the rather lenient Amigaguide
      application stilled displayed without any trouble.</para>

      <para>Grotag takes a different approach: it points even tiny little
      errors, and makes an attempt to fix it in a way that preserves the
      content while resulting in an documents that does not have the issue
      anymore.</para>

      <para>Furthermore Grotag cleans up formatting and upper/lower case in
      mark up.</para>

      <warning>
        <para>Note that the original version of the Amigaguide document will
        be overwritten and consequently be lost unless you made a backup copy
        of it before applying <userinput>--pretty</userinput>.</para>
      </warning>

      <para>In order to clean up the file <filename>ugly.guide</filename>,
      run:</para>

      <para><userinput>grotag --pretty ugly.guide</userinput></para>

      <para>In case you want to clean up multiple files, you can pass all of
      them along at once.</para>
    </section>

    <section id="command-line-html">
      <title>Convert Amigaguide documents to HTML</title>

      <para>To convert an Amigaguide document named
      <filename>some.guide</filename> to a set of HTML documents, run:</para>

      <para><userinput>grotag --html some.guide</userinput></para>

      <para>This creates a folder <filename>some</filename> in the current
      folder, which contains a <filename>*.html</filename> file for each node.
      The file for the main node is always called
      <filename>index.html</filename>.</para>

      <para>To store the output in a different folder, specify it as a second
      option. For example, to store the HTML version of
      <filename>some.guide</filename> in <filename>~/guides</filename>,
      run:</para>

      <para><userinput>grotag --docbook some.guide ~/guides</userinput></para>

      <para>To start reading, open
      <filename>~/guides/some/index.html</filename>.</para>

    <section id="command-line-docbook">
      <title>Convert Amigaguide documents to DocBook XML</title>

      <para>To convert an Amigaguide document named
      <filename>some.guide</filename> to a DocBook XML file named
      <filename>some.xml</filename>, run:</para>

      <para><userinput>grotag --docbook some.guide</userinput></para>

      <para>To use a different name for the output file, specify a second
      file. For example, to store the DocBook version of
      <filename>some.guide</filename> in <filename>other.xml</filename>,
      run:</para>

      <para><userinput>grotag --docbook some.guide
      other.xml</userinput></para>

      <para>The DocBook output does not preserve any formatting command like
      <code>@{b}</code>, <code>@{fg shine}</code> and so in. It only
      reproduces the structure of the document. Each guide represents a
      chapter, and each node is a section. If the Amigaguide document
      specified in the command line links to other documents, they will be
      included in the DocBook output as additional chapters.</para>
